            Hey, my name is Aaron. I am an up-and-coming web developer based out
            of Texas. Extremely excited to learn and grow as a developer. I've
            always wanted to learn how to code. Currently learning how to
            program websites with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and most recently a
            framework called React. Having tons of fun building small projects
            in <span className="test">React</span>. Excited to see just how far this
            takes me.
